# Quato Full Stack Project
[Quato](https://quato.netlify.app/) is a car sale web application where people can buy cars on their own and they can get the cars of their choices.

## Front-end Technologies

I have used React JS for client-side. For form, I used React Hook Form and I have used Firebase authentication system for basic authentication. Also, used Context API for simple props drilling of firebase hook. Bootstrap 5 was used as a CSS framework. This site is mobile responsive.

## Back-end Technologies

I have used Node JS and Express JS for server related work and used MongoDB for database. In the database, I have stored most of the basic information. I have used reviews, orders, users and cars as collection. I have used dotenv as environment variable for security of database user info. For middleware, I have used cors. 

## Features

There are many sections in this web application. The home page has six sections. People can order their favourite car and also there is a dashboard where the user can see their orders. The admin is allowed to make new admins and the admin can see some private stuff.

## Routing

I have used React Routing for general routing in the home page as it is a single page application. Also, for secure routing, I have used Private Route and for dashboard I have used Nested Routing.
